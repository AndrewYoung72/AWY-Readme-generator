# AWY-Readme-generator


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to to develop a program using node.js to develop a professional README generator for my projects. This saves time by allowing me to input my data into the prefab framework constructed using javascript and node.js.
## Description

My README has nine sections. The user is prompted to input the title, a description, table of contents, installtion instructions, usage for the project, credits for the project, choose a license for the project, list ny tests, and list contact information for questions. The description, installation, usage, credit, and test sections are designed for user input. When the user is prompted to choose a license then a list of three license options is presented. When the user chooses a license option then a badge for the license is displayed under the title section and a link to the license page is presented in the license section. My GitHub username and Email address are displayed in the question section. And when the user clicks the links in the table of contents they are taken to the chosen section.
## Lessons

The the most valuable lesson I learned on this project was not to give up and use my terminal to track my errors. I had no idea where to begin on this project. But I watched the classes again and used the mini-project from the previous week as an example to get myself started. Once I was able to get responses on my terminal I could follow my errors to piece my project together. I was able to bring the project to 75% complete on my own but needed help from my tutor to get the list for licenses and badge display for the license to function. Learning the choices option on the license prompt was also a new one for me.
